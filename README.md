The repository contains 2 projects, one for the front-end and one for the backend.


## Backend
The backend runs on port 3010 by default, and it uses and .env file to get the configuration. An example env file is included in the project. Steps to run:

 1. Provide the mongoDB connection string in the .env
 2. Run `cd frontend` to change to the frontend directory
 3. For the first run, run `npm install` to install the dependencies
 4. Run `npm start`

## Frontend
The backend runs on port 3000 by default, and it uses the `/src/config/config.ts` file to get the front-end URL. No changes are required if the port is not changed in the backend. Steps to run:

 1. Run `cd frontend` to change to the frontend directory
 2. For the first run, run `npm install` to install the dependencies
 3. Run `npm start` while in the project folder
